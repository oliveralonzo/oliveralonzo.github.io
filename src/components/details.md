## Research

My work focuses on Computing **Accessibility** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. My research focuses on increasing access to digital information and multimedia for people with sensory disabilities, with particular expertise on designing technologies with and for people who are Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing (DHH). 

Prior work, for example, includes the design and evaluation of automatic text simplificiation tools to provide reading assistance for people who are DHH, tools to assist American Sign Language learners, and ways to caption non-speech sounds in online videos. Current projects span  multimedia accessibility, reading support, access to reliable information, and communication through emerging surfaces (e.g. virtual reality).
