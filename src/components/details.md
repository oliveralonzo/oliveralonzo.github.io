## Research

My work focuses on Computing **Accessibility** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. My research includes the application of automatic text simplification tools to assist online reading by people who are Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing, as well as tools to assist American Sign Language learners. I focus on the user-centric design and evaluation of such tools, as well as the evaluation metrics of the performance of underlying technologies that power them.
